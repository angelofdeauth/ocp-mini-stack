# Rule file for the -m (remapping option)
#
# This file has three fields: operation, regex, remapping
#
# The operation is a combination of the following letters:
#
# r - rewrite the matched string with the remapping pattern
# i - case-insensitive matching
# g - repeat until no match (used with "r")
# e - exit (with success) if we match this pattern, do not process
#     subsequent rules
# s - start over from the first rule if we match this pattern
# a - abort (refuse the request) if we match
