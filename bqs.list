I thought I was doing something wrong but now I'm actually kind of concerned about the hostname -- forward and reverse dns works, hostname is correct on first boot, reverts to localhost.localdomain on next boot and the only manifest is the etcd pod.
etcd does discovery and sets up properly, once the third master is online the bootstrap shuts down leaving the API offline.
any ideas what I'm missing here?
